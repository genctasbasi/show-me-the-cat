## Tech and libraries
* Full **Kotlin**, 100.0%
* **Jetpack compose** with hoisted state to ViewModel
* MVVM architecture with **ViewModels** and uncoupled views with **LiveData**
* **Repository** pattern
* Retrofit for network communication
  * Potential network errors handled
* Separated concerns, **clean architecture** with **Koin** DI
  * I'm familiar with Hilt and Dagger too
* **Coil** for image processing
* **Coroutines** for async execution and good user experience
  * As I gradually move from RxJava to Coroutines / flows - hope it's OK. Can still work with RxJava
* Single activity app
* Idiomatic and readable code with stateless Jetpack compose components
* **Timer** for logging
* Type safety with Sealed classes
* Sample unit tests with **mockk**
  * I'm familiar with **mockito** framework too
